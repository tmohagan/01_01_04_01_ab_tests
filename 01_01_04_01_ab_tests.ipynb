If the gym has only one location, we might have to wear the new uniforms one part of the year, and compare buisness to a comparaable time without the uniforms.\n",

Gyms in areas with better weather might get more business simple becaus more people are willing to get out.  Same thing if we test the results in one store at different times of year.  Uniforms in the summer time might result in better samples only because the weather is better."
